# array_benchmark
Comparing as many languages as possible, using same array algorithm
** Not maintained **
Please see https://github.com/00sapo/cython_list_test for a better comparison.

Free feel however to fork or take a look at the benchmark.

TLDR; Benchmark of array indexing in different languages.
Conclusion from my tinkering, Julia has promise, but Python/Cython is still king at the moment.
